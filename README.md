## Overview
Hello, fellow developer! this is a bot i made in discord.py named **username601.** Username601 is a multi-purpose, rich-feature bot with over 200 commands. This includes moderation, economy, utilities, images, meme-making, and so much more. Please add it to your server! It's worth it! :v  Everything filled on the details below are automatic.
Everything here is open-source to everyone. You can fork it, or do something else.

## The folders
There are two types of parts in this repo. The **website source code** is stored in the **"web"** folder, and **everything else** is for the discord bot itself. (The cogs folder is the "category" folder, and the lib folder is on the "modules" folder)

# Contribute!
If you spot a bug, an enhancement idea, or just a little typo, **you can make a pull request, and merge it here!** Feel free to fork and do something with our code.

# Use this for your bot?
In my opinion, i **do not recommend using this whole code to your bot** since there may be some bugs or something.<br>
But you still can get small snippets of code from this repository.
